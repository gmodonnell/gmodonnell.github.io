<h1>PowerShell</h1>
<p>
The CLI with the weirdest naming conventions. Nothing is syntactically
simple with PowerShell, but maybe that's just a sign I'm not familiar 
enough with it yet. PowerShell is written on the .NET framework, and is 
purpose-built as an automation tool for handling the administration of 
Windows networks. PowerShell runs groups of cmdlets invoked against a 
machine to fulfill this duty. You are going to pipe cmdlets together a lot
when using PowerShell for administration. It is also possible to write
.bat(ch) scripts to run PowerShell routines. > and >> work the same way
in PowerShell as they do in Linux (write vs append).
</p>

<h3>Remoting</h3>
<p>
PowerShell Remoting is a native Windows RCE feature built on top of 
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal">WinRM</a>.
Using the <bold>Invoke-Command</bold> cmdlet is one way to leverage PowerShell Remoting.
This feature can present a huge threat to a network because it has to be enabled 
even within AD Domains. <em>PowerShell Remoting uses HTTP or HTTPS on TCP 5985 and 5986 respectively</em>.
</p>

<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>
There is a notorious logging issue with PowerShell. To combat this, 
defenders have to install <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_logging?view=powershell-5.1">PowerShell Enhanced Logging</a> or a similar
application to allow themselves the ability to properly monitor 
PowerShell activity on their network. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_script_blocks?view=powershell-7.3">Script Block Logging</a> and 
Module Logging are also standard installs for Micro$oft Blue Teams.
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.host/start-transcript?view=powershell-7.3">Transcription Logging </a> is also very useful but requires a lot of fine-tuning. 
The most important thing to remember is that <em>sysadmins must opt in to all these 
defensive measures and tune them effectively</em>. A combination of Script Block Logging and Transcription Logging
will catch most incidents if tuned well. The use of these two modules is the budget solution
for entities low on power or storage space.
