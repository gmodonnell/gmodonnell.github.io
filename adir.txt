ACTIVE DIRECTORY:
AD lets sysadmins update and manage a lot of endpoints at once. Epic. 
AD is also a huge attack surface that you can't ignore. 

Domain Controllers (DC) are the god emperors of AD Environments. DCs are 
Windows 2000-2019 servers with the Active Directory Domain Services installed. 

Windows server ships in Core, Nano and Desktop installations. Only Core and 
Desktop can serve as DCs. Nano installs are too lightweight to handle the 
work required. 

Domains are created, and objects are attached to it. This can be anything 
from an endpoint to a Group Policy. Organizational Units are used to 
keep everything categorized.
