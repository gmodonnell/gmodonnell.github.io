Often when on engagement, it is easiest to create an EC2 or other cloud
instance from which you can use tools. This is convenient for the client's
Blue Team, as they only have to worry about a single IP Address from which 
all traffic related to the ongoing test will originate.
</p>
<p>
When I work through an EC2, I have to ssh into the box and use my tools 
through the CLI. This generally isn't an issue, but if I need to use 
BurpSuite, the problem of not having a GUI gets in the way. To combat this,
I use Dynamic Port Forwarding to forward my BurpSuite traffic through the 
EC2 instance I have an ssh connection with. Here's how to do it:
</p>
<p>
Open BurpSuite, go to Project Options (or user options for a permanent change which I don't recommend).
Under SOCKS proxy, enable all the shit and run the SOCKS proxy address as 127.0.0.1. <em>you can't put localhost</em>
Next you set the port to whatever you want your port to be. 
SSH into the box, and set the -D flag with your port matching the port you indicated in BurpSuite.
Activate your Burp Proxy as usual. The traffic will flow from the browser through burp to your EC2 out into the world.
