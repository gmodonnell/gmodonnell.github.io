Directory Traversal Attacks:
============================
Webapps that use the ?page= param are often vulnerable to 
directory traversal attacks. 

Linux:
../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
get the users and then check their .ssh folder
if you get private keys you might be able to 
ssh into the endpoint or network.

Windows:
C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\
Logfile location on IIS
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
config file can sometimes have creds.

Remember to \ for windows and / for *nix
