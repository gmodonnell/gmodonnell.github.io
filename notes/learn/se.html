<h1>Social Engineering</h1>
<p>If you're reading this and learning things, go outside.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Social Engineering is when you spec into Charisma, and use that to 
circumnavigate the majority of the Dex challenges other hackers
would face. As technology evolves, physical entry and cyberattacks
become more difficult. Kevin Mitnick tells a fun story
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScRl8Gudt-4">here</a> about
the kinds of skills you can expect to hone to specialize in this area. 
It is almost always more reliable and safer than aggravated entry. 
All it takes to run a successful SE Engagement is a little OSINT and 
a lot of patience. Every thorough security assessment should include
social engineering in the RoE. 
</p>
<p>
Social Engineering preys on curiosity and lack of awareness in others.
Entire departments exist in businesses whose sole purpose is to provide
information to others. These people get curious and they leak information
all the time. That's why SE works: it's easy. People will always be hackable
until the human brain sees a fundamental change in its operation and 
architecture. People are hardwired to respond to certain stimuli, meaning 
SE can be a predictable practice. <a href="https://abagnale.com/about/frank.htm">
Frank Abagnale</a> was very good at SE and I recommend you look into him. The
movie Catch Me if You Can was based off Frank's life. 
</p>
<p>
Lots of SE strategies are based on the fallible nature of heuristics. This is 
because while heuristics are based off experience, they are still assumptions
and subject to bias. People operate off heuristics because their recall 
capabilities are limited, and exposing the assumptions people use to make their
everyday decisions is a surefire way to get what you want. Information warfare 
operates in the physical, informational and cognitive domains. SE takes place 
in the cultural domain. Language, Religion, Ethnicity, Nationality and other
cultural factors will play a part in how people interact with you, what they 
judge as important and where they choose to locate themselves during the day.
Some people, like the information desk, don't realize the value of the data 
they hold. Others, like HR, Marketing and Customer Service interface with people
all the time and are focused on helping others. All members of a business are 
conditioned to respond to authority figures and trust certain sources implicitly.
Keep these things in mind while developing an attack.
</p>
<h3>Social Triggers</h3>
<p>
There are lots of social triggers that people are almost guaranteed to react 
to in a consistent way. Here are six of them:
<blockquote>
<b>Reciprocation</b> - When someone does something and you feel obligated 
to act in a manner of return, that's reciprocation. When a store offers
you a sample of a product, there is a social obligation to purchase the
product should you find you like the sample. If a small favor is done for
you, you feel obligated to do a small favor back. Sometimes all this takes
is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opRMrEfAIiI">polite questioning</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Authority</b> - People will tend to conform to the demands of a perceived
higher power. If someone projects authority, regardless of whether or not they
have it, people will listen to them. A popular example of this is when mall cops
dress up as cops. They are not police, but they will command more respect simply
by wearing a uniform. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">
Milgram Experiment</a> is a wonderful example of how powerful an appeal to 
authority can be. Wearing the uniform and cloning (or even imitating) the badge 
can make or break an op.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Social Proof</b> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof">Social Proof</a>
 is the subconscious desire to emulate others in order to fit in. 
 Peer pressure is one of the aspects of social proof. Even groups 
who try to stand out from the "rest" like goths will emulate each other so they 
still maintain a degree of conformity and belonging. In some countries, how closely
you stand to someone while talking is an important social indicator. American handshakes
are firm and quick but Middle Eastern handshakes are softer and last forever. To be
accepted in a foreign environment, you will need the same mannerisms.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Commitment & Consistency</b> - People want to be viewed as reliable; consistent in 
their actions and words. If you ask a question that begs a yes, and then follow it 
with a few more that also beg yes, you can drastically increase the ask with a hard 
question after the person has built up a small reputation of being helpful and saying
"yes" in the moment. Making it difficult for people to say no can result in some 
irrational behavior, which is the goal. This is why cashiers are told to ask you
out loud if you want to donate to the children's hospital. When you're called out in
public like that, there is a perceived social pressure to donate so people don't see
you turn down the donation. Creating a pattern and then exploiting the cycle is how
you manage this social trigger.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Liking</b> - Liking is simple and powerful. If you see someone you like, you will
want to help them because you want them to like you. Commanding this affection requires
the establishment of rapport. You can find common interests with someone or you can be
attractive and just talk about anything. This is why celebrity endorsements work. You 
want to fuck Scarlet Johannsen so you're going to buy a Lincoln because you saw her 
driving one in a commercial. Popular social media trends are coming out where people
answer a question or post a photo and then pass the trend on. Think of lists where
you fill out interests about yourself or everyone posting their New Year photos. SE
attackers will generate these trends and then scrape them for credentials. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Scarcity</b> - People are pressured to act when they think there is a limitation 
imposed on their actions. People are motivated by the idea they might miss out or
that supplies/time are limited. People also think that more expensive is synonymous
with more exclusive, so retailers will mark up a product price and will actually 
sell more of that product. Scarcity is the practice of instilling panic and creating
a rush where it doesn't exist.

<h3>Phases of Social Engineering</h3>
<p>
Every Social Engineering Operation has Four Main Phases that guide a team through 
properly researching, approaching and exploiting our target.
<blockquote>
<b>Research</b> - This is the most time consuming phase. Enumerating the target is 
something you cannot do to much. OSINT until you think you've done everything you
possibly can, adn then do some more. Look at social media websites, employee blogs, 
news articles etc. Search for interests and connections that can be made between
an organization/employee and your agent. Who do they network with? How do these 
people connect to the organizaton? When you have a good amount of information,
build a target package: A dossier of organized, prioritized information that will
help you identify vulnerabilities in the ogranization and the people who work there.
Developing targets requires the use of smart searches, geolocation through metadata,
reverse image searching, scanning posted documents etc. Learning and using Maltego 
is a good way to manage data but it's also freemium.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>The Hook</b> - This is the phase where you initiate contact with your target. It 
is the first impression and the first step toward cultivating a relationship. Interests
should have been researched prior so you or your agent can manufacture an interest 
in them prior to initial contact. If you are choosing to approach the target as a peer,
know the jargon. Start with small asks to build rapport and see if they are willing to 
help you at all. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>The Play</b>
If the target appears compliant and willing, start pressing them. Don't be worried. The 
intelligence you value so highly is day to day information for the target, they do not 
understand the value of the intel they hold. No matter how long they have been in industry,
a target holding information long enough will eventually become desensitized to its importance. 
This is the most demanding phase in terms of skill. You have to press hard enough to get what 
you want, but not so hard that you burn your source. Be patient and don't overplay your hand.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>The Exit</b>
This is when it's time to GTFO. You don't want to make a scene or arouse suspicion, otherwise
the intel could be compromised. Always ask additional, irrelevant information prior to your 
exit so the mark is misled. Be appreciative and polite as you clean up so nobody has a foul
taste in their mouth after you disappear. Once you're done, move on or move up. 
</blockquote>
</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
Triggers and Phases are nothing without the proper Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP).
Here are 5 of the top mehtods employed in this space. 
<blockquote>
<b>Phishing</b> - An common and effective technique, even when applied at a grand scale.
Through the phone or email, you can represent something you are not and extract data from an 
organization. Typical triggers for shotgun phishing attacks are fear, urgency and authority.
Spear-Phishing is where the true artistry comes in because it is dedicated against a single
target which means the prior research must be in-depth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Pre-Texting</b> - A pretext is a slippery story you spin to subdue or seduce a certain 
individual or group. You generate a scenario that allows you to extract information under the
guise of being someone else or working for something you don't belong to. Pretexts are based 
on trust, not fear.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Baiting</b> - Baiting is a when a reward is offered for information. If you phish a group of
people telling them they could win an iPhone if they sign up for a company raffle, then scrape 
their credentials as they log in to your bad portal to "authenticate" you're baiting. You would
be surprised how many people are willing to give up PII or passwords for a free pen.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Quid Pro Quo</b> - The exchange of a service for a service. Calling an employee as the IT
department and telling them if they give you 15 minutes and press some funny buttons on their
computer they can speed up their internet is a classic example.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Tailgating</b> - Dressing as a deliveryman is a great way to get people to hold the door for you. 
Alternatively just dress the same and follow people in. If you are going after an organization that
has single file badge entry or higher you shouldn't be reading this primer right now. Once you're in,
just find an empty desk and ask the person next to it if you can hotel.
