<h1>SecureSHell</h1>
<p>
SSH or SecureSHell uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to maintain
Perfect Forward Secrecy* between two clients. Here's how it works:
</p>
<p>
When we browse the web, the client must authenticate the server. 
However, when SSH is being used, both the client and server must
authenticate. The server uses a private key that lets the client 
verify the authenticity of the serverr with a public key
kept on file by the client. When it's tim to talk, the client and
server don't exchange symmetric keys using AES over RSA, they
use Diffie-Hellman instead.
</p>
<p>
Diffie-Hellman is a public key technique but unlike RSA, it does
not rely on factoring large numbers. Diffie-Hellman requires each
member of the exchange have their common values and secret values.
Here is an example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
	g = 29
	p = 101
	p is the modulus
	g is the base
	A Secret = 17
	B Secret = 61
	
    DH Exchange does the following: 
	A calculates g^A mod p to derive Aprime
		29^17 mod 101 = 63 || pow(29,17,101) = 63
	B calculates g^B mod p to derive Bprime
		29^61 mod 101 = 99 || pow(29,61,101) = 99
	
    Aprime is sent to B and Bprime is sent to A
	A calculates Bprime^Aprime mod p to derive S
		99^17 mod 101 = 26 || pow(99,17,101)
	B calculates Aprime^Bprime mod p to derive S
		63^61 mod 101 = 26 || pow(63,61,101) 
	S is the Shared Secret! This is possible because (g^a)^b = (g^b)^a 
	Every time for any values this is true. 
    
    The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is hoping that if an attacker gets
    ahold of g and ga they will not be able to recover the original
    exponent a. This is the Discrete Log Problem and is computationally
    difficult for large values.

<p>
SSH mitigates the risk of session replay attacks but does not 
eliminate the risk entirely because you can still have your 
session hijacked.
</p>

<p>
*Perfect Forward Secrecy is a security concept defining the access 
threat actors have if your keys are compromised. In the ideal Perfect
Forward Secrecy environment, even if your keys are compromised your 
previous sessions cannot be decrypted. Not all implementations of SSL
do this. If your RSA keys are stolen, for example, you are absolutely
fucked as an attacker can use your RSA key to crack your AES session key
and get ahold of everything even encrypted with those keys. SSH allows for 
PFS because the generated keys are ephemeral.
