Hopefully it will be searchable soon.
Working on it.

<h2>Cryptography</h2>
<p>
Cryptography is how we protect our information using a lot of 
complex math. Cryptography is what allows us to transmit sensitive
information across insecure networks without having to lose sleep.
</p>
<p>
There are three types of cryptographic systems we operate:
Symmetric Encryption, Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Symmetric Encryption</th>
<th>Asymmetric Encryption</th>
<th>Hashing</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uses one shared key to encrypt and decrypt messages</td>
<td>Uses pairs of keys, one for encryption and one for decryption.</td>
<td>One-Way functions that produce a fixed length output unique to the 
source message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fast. Less Computing.</td>
<td>Slower. More Computing.</td>
<td>Must be computationally impossible to reverse the process. Every
input must generate a unique output.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Used for Messaging and Data Storage</td>
<td>Used for key exchange authentication and digital signatures.</td>
<td>Used for integrity checks, non-repudiation and digital signatures.</td>
</tr>
