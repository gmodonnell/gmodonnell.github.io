<h2>BloodHound Active Directory</h2>
<article>
<p>
BloodHound is an awesome tool that makes attacking Active Directory super easy.
It is also almost always picked up by AntiVirus because it's so popular. There
are a couple ways to get around AV, and aside from the traditional methods, you
can get around AV pretty easily to collect information with SharpHound provided
the following conditions are met:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
You have a device connected to the target network, but not to the domain.
You have valid credentials for a domain-connected user.
You have identified a domain controller on the network.
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Now, you can run Sharphound on your network connected device, and direct the 
protocols toward the domain. Here's how:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
1. Assign the previously identified Domain Controller's IP as your system DNS server.
2. Use your captured credentials to generate a CMD shell as that user:
    C:\> runas /netonly /user:[DOMAIN]\[USER] cmd.exe
3. Verify your domain authentication:
    C:\> net view \\[DOMAIN]\
4. Run SharpHound from your device, and point it at the proper domain:
    C:\> SharpHound.exe -d [DOMAIN].local
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
I have found that often times, running this command as the docs recommend will fail.
The docs also recommend you use the <code>OverrideUserName</code> flag with the 
above command, but this will also fail. The only reliable way I have discovered is to
force your credentials down SharpHound's throat as follows:
<blockquote>
<code>
<pre>
C:\> SharpHound.exe -d [DOMAIN].local --OverrideUserName [USER] --LdapUsername [USER] --LdapPassword [PASS]
</pre>
</code>
</blockquote>
Do this on the shell you spawned with <code>runas /netonly</code> and it won't fail.
Because you've covered all your bases.
