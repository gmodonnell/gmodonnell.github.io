<h2>BloodHound Active Directory</h2>
<article>
<p>
BloodHound is an awesome tool that makes attacking Active Directory super easy.
It is also almost always picked up by AntiVirus because it's so popular. There
are a couple ways to get around AV, and aside from the traditional methods, you
can get around AV pretty easily to collect information with SharpHound provided
the following conditions are met:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
You have a device connected to the target network, but not to the domain.
You have valid credentials for a domain-connected user.
You have identified a domain controller on the network.
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Now, you can run Sharphound on your network connected device, and direct the 
protocols toward the domain. Here's how:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
1. Assign the previously identified Domain Controller's IP as your system DNS server.
2. Use your captured credentials to generate a CMD shell as that user:
    C:\> runas /netonly /user:[DOMAIN]\[USER] cmd.exe
3. Verify your domain authentication:
    C:\> net view \\[DOMAIN]\
4. Run SharpHound from your device, and point it at the proper domain:
    C:\> SharpHound.exe -d [DOMAIN].local
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
I have found that often times, running this command as the docs recommend will fail.
The docs also recommend you use the <code>OverrideUserName</code> flag with the 
above command, but this will also fail. The only reliable way I have discovered is to
force your credentials down SharpHound's throat as follows:
<blockquote>
<code>
<pre>
C:\> SharpHound.exe -d [DOMAIN].local --OverrideUserName [USER] --LdapUsername [USER] --LdapPassword [PASS]
</pre>
</code>
</blockquote>
Do this on the shell you spawned with <code>runas /netonly</code> and it won't fail.
Because you've covered all your bases.
</p>
<h3>Running from Linux</h3>
<p>
It's a pain to run PowerShell from Linux the way BloodHound wants it done, so use
this <a href="https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py">BloodHound Python</a>
implementation instead. You may have to spoonfeed it to get it to work:
<blockquote>
<code>
<pre>
bloodhound-python --domain [DOMAIN] -c All -ns [NS IP] -dc [DC NAME] -u [USER] -p [PASS]
</pre>
</code>
</blockquote>
The Domain Controller name will be the prefix, not the FQDN. The Domain will be
everything but the prefix, so when you combine the two options you will have a FQDN.
</p>

<h3>Directing Attention</h3>
<p>
Many paths will not be revealed to you if you can't properly parse through the
domain and select your prioritized targets properly. There are a few recommended
targets which need to be marked that are not marked by default. These are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups with the AdminCount flag, or local admin allowed</li>
<li>Reset Password Privilege Groups</li>
<li>Unconstrained Delegation that aren't DCs</li>
<li>Azure AD Connect Servers</li>
<li>Certificate Publishers</li>
</ul>
<p>
We should also check to see if there are any LAPS non-enabled computers. This 
can aid lateral movement through the network.
