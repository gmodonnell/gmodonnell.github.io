<h2>Proxying BurpSuite</h2>
<article>
<p>
When working on a team, setting up a lab environment is the ideal method for 
working together. This is convenient for the client's
Blue Team, as they only have to worry about a single IP Address from which 
all traffic related to the ongoing test will originate.
</p>
<p>
When working through a lab, I have to ssh into the box and use my tools 
through the CLI. This generally isn't an issue, but if I need to use 
BurpSuite, the problem of not having a GUI gets in the way. To combat this,
I use Dynamic Port Forwarding to forward my BurpSuite traffic through the 
EC2 instance I have an ssh connection with. Here's how to do it:
</p>
<p>
Open BurpSuite, go to Project Options (or user options for a permanent change which I don't recommend).
Under SOCKS proxy, enable everything and run the SOCKS proxy address as 127.0.0.1. <em>you can't put localhost</em>.
Next you set the port to whatever you want your port to be. 
SSH into the box, and set the -D flag with your port matching the port you indicated in BurpSuite.
Activate your Burp Proxy as usual. The traffic will flow from the browser through burp to your EC2 out into the world.
</p>
<h3>Forwarding</h3>
<p>
Local port forwards are a good way to ensure a connection takes an unorthodox route. 
If you're dodging firewalls or routing tools through an access point on an internal
network. Local port forwards will take outgoing data from a local port,
and connect it to a different port on the target box. Here is the general format:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
ssh -N -L [port]:localhost:[port] user@domain
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
using <code>-N</code> prevents ssh from running a command or opening a shell,
but will forward the port. You can do this through multiple layers of network,
for example your device touches a VPS that exists between you and a target network.
If you have access to a device on that network, you can push traffic from the 
victim device all the way down to the screen in front of your keyboard.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
ssh -N -R [port]:localhost:[port] user@domain
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Above is a remote port forward, which will set the first port on a remote device to
accept connections and forward them to the second port on the remote device. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plant a device on the target network. Set a reverse port forward on it
to reach back to your lab environment.
</li>
<li>
Set a local port forward from the client device to the lab environment.
</li>
<li>
The data will now kiss in the middle.
</li>
<p>
I don't X-11 forward for GUI applications because I don't know 
enough about it to run it securely.
