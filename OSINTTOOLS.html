<p>These are some of my favorite tools for OSINT. Grouped by function,
    these are websites which I have found to be particularly useful.
    Be warned, most of these are clearnet and some require accounts.

<h3>Emails/Credentials</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://hunter.io">Hunter.io</a> is good for
    finding corporate email accounts which are associated
    with a particular domain you may be interested in. Account
    required.</li>
    <li><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, and
    <a href="https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse">Breach-Parse</a>
    have both been good ways to see if any targets have already been compromised. 
    Even if you have an old password, it could still be in use on another service
    the target has employed. 
    </li>
</ul>
